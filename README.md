# Libet 

### Running

The simplest and most reliable way of running the experiment was doing it from 
'Psychopy Coder'. Simply, download newest version from https://www.psychopy.org/download.html and once you do run it, three windows should pop up 'PsychoPy Builder', 'PsychoPy Coder', and 'PsychoPy Runner'. In 'PsychoPy Coder' click a second icon from the left on the task bar which will open choose a file menu. Find 'libet.py' and hit enter. 

Once you opened our script in 'PsychoPy Coder' click the play button and script should run while outputting its logs to 'PsychoPy Runner'.
